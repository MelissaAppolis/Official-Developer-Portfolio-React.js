                <p>I am a certified full stack web developer from Cape Town, South Africa. 
                    I have recently started my career as a web developer. I decided to make a bold move in my life 
                    and completely switch careers, this does not come as a surprise as I am very ambitious. 
                    I am passionate about desiging and building web applications from scratch.
